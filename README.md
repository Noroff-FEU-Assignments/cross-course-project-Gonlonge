```






2. Install the dependencies:

```

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

## Contact

This is where you can leave your social links for people to contact you, such as a LinkedIn profile or Twitter link e.g.

[My Twitter page](www.twitter.com)

[My LinkedIn page](www.linkedin.com)

## License

You can link to your license file here if you're using one, or mention what license the codebase falls under. If you're unsure then you can simply delete this section.

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can add any acknowledgements if you'd like, such as to people who have helped you or any code snippets you'd like to mention. You can delete this section if you don't have any acknowledgements to make.
